Pyber with Matplotlib

# Overview of Analysis:
## Pyber Analysis

By using Matplotlib to compare the data from various types of cities we can compare which areas produce the most profit and see where more drivers may be needed.  First we will format the raw data from our csv file and change it into dataframes which show a table of total rides, total drivers, total fares, and the averages of the fare per ride and fare per driver.  This table will give use a side by side comparative view of the counts and averages for the three types of cities.  Here we can more accuractely see that the differences between the types of cities and begin to see where changes can be made.

# Results:
## What can we see...

When we look at the new chart showing the three types of cities, we can see that the Urban areas are the most profitable, total fares making $39,854.38 which is $20,498.05 more than the next highest total in Suburban areas.  However if we look closer we can actually see that Rural areas make more based on the average fare
per ride and average fare per driver.  This gives us a better picture of how more drivers in an area does not necessarily mean more profit.  When we look at this data in a line chart the differences and similarities become more visually evident.

# Summary:
## What can we do...

At first glance, the data shows that Urban areas have the most total rides and total drivers and total fares.  Which only shows that high volume does not necessarily mean that we will have the highest profits in those areas.  In fact we can see that there are more drivers than actual rides from this information.  Based on the line chart we can see that the time is not too much of a factor as all three areas experience certian monthly trends.  February being the month with peaks of fares and eventual drops the most visible.  
Seeing that each type of city can result in more even distirbution of fares the Suburban model would be the closest driver to fare ratio that gives us steady results without having the overage of drivers like Urban areas.  In order to make all ares more evenly profitable I would suggest the following:
  1.  Lower the total number of drivers to met the demand of rides.  
  2.  Increase the number of drivers in Rural and Suburban areas to match demand of rides.  
  3.  Use quarterly analysis to show the productively and trends in shifting usage and also to start tracking distance in these areas to get a better idea how distance factors into ride usage.  

If we implement these changes we will begin to really get a better picture of how driver distribution, ride distance, and fare price are affecting Pyber's bottom line.  Then as the years go on we can make gradual changes keeping Pyber at the top of the list of most profitable ride share companies and make our stock more attractive to possible investors.  

Thank you and enjoy the luncheon prepared for you in the hall next door.
